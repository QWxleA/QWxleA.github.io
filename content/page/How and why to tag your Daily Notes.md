### About resurfacing information from your Daily Notes

  + During the day I run into many interesting topics, tweets, posts on Reddit, thoughts from books, too many to keep track of. I keep _everything_ that I _might_ want to use later, some people are picky, I'm not. Not being picky means I don't have to make any decisions _right now_ -> which reduces [[friction]].

  + If not tagged, the daily note becomes a black hole where information just disappears. There is just {{< logseq/mark >}}too much information to be useful.{{< / logseq/mark >}}


  + Tags help to create _buckets_ of slightly related items. But, Ahrens writes in __How to Take Smart Notes__ that {{< logseq/mark >}}tags "should be chosen carefully and sparsely"{{< / logseq/mark >}} (otherwise you move the problem from _too many daily notes_ to _too many tags_).

  + Don't use tags as a filing-system, _tag with the output, or end-use in mind_. When do I want to find this note again, **not**: this belongs here.

  + Tags are effectively a filter. You can use simple queries to {{< logseq/mark >}}find information you need, when you need it{{< / logseq/mark >}}:

  + A query like: `{{query (and [[tags and keywords]] [[@Andy Matuschak]] )}}`, produces:

### Technical background

  + In [logseq]({{< ref "logseq" >}}) tags and links are technically treated the same, but in practical use they are not the same:

    + **tags** are a system of classification

    + **links** are an API to a note -> easy linkable nodes
