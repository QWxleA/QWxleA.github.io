The Pomodoro Technique is a [time management](/page/time management) method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It {{< logseq/mark >}}uses a timer to break work into intervals{{< / logseq/mark >}}, traditionally {{< logseq/mark >}}25 minutes{{< / logseq/mark >}} in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. â€” [Pomodoro Technique - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Why does it work (for me)?

  + Easy to start, 25 minutes is small enough to be negligible, while long enough to get something done.
