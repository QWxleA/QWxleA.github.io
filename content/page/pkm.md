> Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their {{< logseq/mark >}}daily activities{{< / logseq/mark >}} (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in which these processes support work activities (Wright 2005). It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own {{< logseq/mark >}}growth and learning{{< / logseq/mark >}} (Smedley 2009). It is a {{< logseq/mark >}}bottom-up approach{{< / logseq/mark >}} to knowledge management (KM) (Pollard 2008).
