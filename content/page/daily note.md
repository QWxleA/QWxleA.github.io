## Notes

  + The habit of starting _all_ writing in the daily note reduces friction and stress

    + It is just easy, you don't have to think where stuff goes. Journaling in itself reduces stress

    + If I like it I can put it in more permanent place

    + Play-space, solves high barrier. Prototype and just write.

  + Logging progress in the daily journal creates the possibility to see progress

    + Logging -> seeing -> improvement

  + For daily notes to have _lasting value_ they must be tagged and [linked]([[linking]])

    + If not tagged, the daily note becomes a black hole where information just disappears. There is just {{< logseq/mark >}}too much information to be useful.{{< / logseq/mark >}}
    + information disappears if it is not reused again, later

  + Use [spaced repetition](/page/spaced-repetition) for ideas noted in the daily note that have no current links?
