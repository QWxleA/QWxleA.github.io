We, as people, are social animals. We live together, we work together, we relax together, but what about *learning* together? In these days of global pandemics and, be honest, living inside our digital tools we have slowly gone back to being not-very-social. [Digital gardens]([digital garden]({{< ref "digital garden" >}})) are one way to overcome this *modern ill*. Learning and building/creating in such a way that it is easy for others to see and/or comment on what you do and learn.

At the same time, being too busy with the technical part will detract from doing any learning, so it should be simple to go from your [system](pkm) where you keep your notes/keep track of what you learn, to a website. With the help a a plugin it is easy to export all your public pages, combined with a [hugo]({{< ref "hugo" >}}) theme that *knows* back-links and other [logseq]({{< ref "logseq" >}}) specific tricks, you can now start building your own [garden]([digital garden]({{< ref "digital garden" >}})).
