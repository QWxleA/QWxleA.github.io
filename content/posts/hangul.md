After an interesting [conversation](https://rage.love/@ljwrites/105592890222523701) on Mastodon, I thought it would be interesting to look into  [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Letters) or Korean, for the non-initiated. Languages are always fascinating, and non-latin languages doubly so. I can only read Latin, Cyrillic, and (Ancient) Greek, so anything to the west of Europe is new and interesting. On to hangul.

The first article I read was [A Quick Guide to Hangul, the Korean Alphabet - Pronunciation and Rules](https://www.mondly.com/blog/2020/05/25/hangul-korean-alphabet-pronunciation/) on 'mondly', an app I use on my phone to improve my French. It's not really helping, but the app is not to blame. An interesting quote from the article was:

> For hundreds of years before Hangul was created, Koreans wrote using Classical Chinese characters (which they called Hanja) alongside other native phonetic writing systems. However, many lower-class people didn’t know how to read or write because of the fundamental differences between Korean and Chinese and, of course, because of the large number of Chinese characters. After all, even today, many people find Chinese and Japanese very difficult to learn because of their complex writing systems. My scientific research ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My%5FSassy%5FGirl%5F(TV%5Fseries))) noticed the same thing:

{{< figure src="/images/hangul-chinese.png" caption="Figure 1: Chinese writing in the Joseon era" >}}

Both Chinese and Japanese have, or use an enormous amount of characters, which makes it definitely nin-trivial for the non-native speaker to even get a glimpse of the language. The Korean alphabet, on the other hand, has only 24 basic latters, and they use not more then 5 strokes, so they don't look too complicated. Having studied several eastern european languages in the past, it was interesting to see several sounds we don't really have in the west, have equivalents in Korean and cyrillic, for example ㅈ (romanized 'ch', but not really see [Further reading #3](#further-reading) ) is somewhere between ч 'chai' or 'checkmate' and ц 'tsar'. Also, it always amazes me that, listening to the videos, it is obvious that for the native speaker, the diferences between sounds are very clear, and obvious, but to me it often sounds as if they just repeat the same sound. It was the same studying Russian, and I remember when I gradually started to notice the difference between sounds, it's fascinating how the brain works!

[Downloaded and installed Anki]({{< relref "spaced-repetition-learning-with-emacs" >}}) with a 'hangul' deck, let's see how that goes.
