BleachBit is one of those apps that you don't really think about, but are great to have. As far as I can tell it is possible to do everything the app does in shell-scripts, bur honestly, do **you** have time to figure out wh is cluttering up your harddisk all the time? I rather spend time on my [zsh config](https://github.com/QWxleA/qwZsh).

The latest version came out in [Januari 2021](https://www.bleachbit.org/news/bleachbit-420), and it has a cleaner for zoom now. Nice!

Cleaned up 4.34Gb today. Wished that cleaning at home was just as fast.
