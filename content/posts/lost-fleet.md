Read most of the series in 2018, at least, what had been available then. Genesis fleet I haven't read yet.

The Lost Fleet is a military science fiction series written by John G. Hemry under the pen name Jack Campbell. The whole series feels very 'greek', which is no surprise: Hemry acknowledged in an interview that The Lost Fleet was inspired by Xenophon's Anabasis, detailing the return march of the Ten Thousand, and myths about kings returning to save their nation. In the same interview, Hemry, based on his own military experience, found Geary to be his ideal commanding officer. Ancestor worship is a belief system fairly homogeneously embraced within Hemry's universe. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FLost%5FFleet#section=7))
