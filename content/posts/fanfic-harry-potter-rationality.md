The Harry Potter books, despite being 'young adult' books, are a great read. Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable.

As with all great series, when it's over, then what?

For Harry Potter, it's fanfiction, most of it is terrible, but some is actually great:

-   [Fanfic: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality)

Surprisingly, it even has a [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%5FPotter%5Fand%5Fthe%5FMethods%5Fof%5FRationality) page. It was published as a serial from 28 February 2010 through to 14 March 2015. It consists of 122 chapters and 661,619 words. I read the whole thing twice :-).

And it has been printed in book form:
