## Publication order {#publication-order}

Publication order sort-of works -- it's the order that Bujold wrote the stories in, after all -- but she jumps back and forth in Miles's life fairly randomly. Publication order works for those who prefer to read the books in - more or less (Barrayar was half-written as the continuation of Shards of Honour, abandoned for several years, and then completed) -- the order the author wrote them.

-   'Aftermaths' (Spring 1986)
-   Shards of Honour (June 1986)
