**Welcome!** Have a 🍵 or a 🍹, and find something to 📰

This is my experiment with a [digital garden](/page/digital-garden) "learning in public".

I keep my notes in a system gracefully called a [[pkm]], a "Personal Knowledge Management" system.

This [[Hugo]] site is its frontend. The system is still bare, as I am figuring out how all these things work, and how to do this "public" thing.

Some of the subjects I am interested in (at the moment): are [[logseq]], [[javascript]] and [[pkm]].
