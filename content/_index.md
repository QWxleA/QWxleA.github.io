**Welcome!** Have a 🍵 or a 🍹, and find something to 📰

This is my experiment with a [digital garden](/page/digital-garden) "learning in public".

I keep my notes in a system gracefully called a [pkm](/page/pkm), a "Personal Knowledge Management" system.

This [Hugo](/page/hugo) site is its frontend. The system is still bare, as I am figuring out how all these things work, and how to do this "public" thing.

Some of the subjects I am interested in (at the moment): are [logseq](/page/logseq), [javascript](/page/javascript) and [pkm](/page/pkm).
