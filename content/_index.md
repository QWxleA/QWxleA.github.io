**Welcome!** Have a 🍵 or a 🍹, and find something to 📰

This is my experiment with a [digital garden]({{< ref "/page/digital garden" >}}) "learning in public".

I keep my notes in a system gracefully called a [pkm]({{< ref "/page/pkm" >}}), a "Personal Knowledge Management" system.

This [Hugo]({{< ref "/page/Hugo" >}}) site is its frontend. The system is still bare, as I am figuring out how all these things work, and how to do this "public" thing.

Some of the subjects I am interested in (at the moment): are [logseq]({{< ref "/page/logseq" >}}), [javascript]({{< ref "/page/javascript" >}}) and [pkm]({{< ref "/page/pkm" >}}).
