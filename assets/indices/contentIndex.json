    "content": "My mom complained about an English only TV series on Disney+. What's a helpful son to do?\n\nAs it happens, streaming to a Chromecast is not hard, but sending subtitles to it seems to be all but impossible. So, hardcoded subs it is (Just like the nineties, how retro!).\n\n## Step by step\n\n  + This was the easiest way to get some subtitled videos on TV:\n+ Take an English only video file, from _somewhere_ on the  internet (exercise left to the reader.)\n+ Find subtitles, cannot find anything in Dutch, find in English, easy to do.\n+ Translate with Google translate (surprisingly good, Ulysses this tv-series is not, but still, happily surprised).\n+ The timings are often wrong. [SubShifter - Online SRT Subtitle Resync Tool](https://subshifter.bitsnbites.eu/) is a good tool. I just use VLC to find when people start to talk and sync with this. The couple of times I've done this it was just to find a correct start.\n+ Next the key to the whole conundrum: [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/). This app has been around for years, but is still actively developed and relatively easy to use.\n+ A good alternative is [Subler](https://subler.org/), it is *way* faster, but cannot hardcode subs, so  for this Handbrake is the obvious choice.\n\n  + ### Handbrake\n\n    + To setup Handbrake for encoding on an M1, you need to use the correct settings (the app is universal):\nConfiguration: **Video** \u003e **H.265 (VideoToolbox)** \u0026 **Chromecast 1080p**\n\n![handbrake.png](/assets/handbrake_1649418443446_0.png)\n\n    + These settings cut the encoding time in half (still _not_ instantaneous). Next, add everything to the queue and get something to eat.\n\n### Playback ‚Äî attempt 1\n\n  + The easiest way to send a video file to a Chromecast is using the Chrome Browser:\n+ Serve files: `python3 -m http.server 8080`+\n+ Open in Google Chrome+\n+ `‚´∂` \u003e **Cast** \u003e **TV (Chromecast)**, done+\n\n  + Worked well, but no way I get my mom to run a local webserver.\n\n### Playback ‚Äî attempt 2\n\n  + VLC is a decent player, and it's _old_, so people are bound to have used it:\n+ Use VLC to stream, open file\n+ Then **Playback** \u003e **Renderer** \u003e **TV (Chromecast)**",
