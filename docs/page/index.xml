      <description>We, as people, are social animals. We live together, we work together, we relax together, but what about learning together? In these days of global pandemics and, be honest, living inside our digital tools we have slowly gone back to being not-very-social. Digital gardens are one way to overcome this modern ill: Learning and building/creating in such a way that it is easy for others to see and/or comment on what you do and learn.</description>

      <description>The plan is to collect useful snippets and code-examples to help creating and maintaining a pkm in Hugo (and posibly Logseq).
   Automating import  To import pages from logseq:
#!/usr/bin/env bash  BLOG=$HOME/Documents/QWxleA.github.io NOTES=$BLOG/content/notes ASSETS=&amp;#34;$BLOG/content/notes/assets&amp;#34; HUGOASSETS=$BLOG/static/assets  STARTPAGE=&amp;#34;$NOTES/Start here.md&amp;#34;  ZIP=$HOME/Downloads/publicExport.zip  explode() {  # rm $NOTES/*.md   unzip -o -d $NOTES $ZIP  if [ -d &amp;#34;$ASSETS&amp;#34; ]; then  for a in $ASSETS/*; do  mv &amp;#34;$a&amp;#34; $HUGOASSETS  done  rmdir &amp;#34;$ASSETS&amp;#34;  fi  # FIXME  if [ -f &amp;#34;$STARTPAGE&amp;#34; ]; then  mv &amp;#34;$STARTPAGE&amp;#34; &amp;#34;$BLOG/content/_index.</description>

      <description>Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their  daily activities  (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in which these processes support work activities (Wright 2005). It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own  growth and learning  (Smedley 2009). It is a  bottom-up approach  to knowledge management (KM) (Pollard 2008).</description>

Queries are build in a language called datalog, the presentation is done using Hiccup. Mixed in is Clojure, of which I know none.
   Debugging    Usually I add one of these to view raw data from a query before I add custom hiccup view
  :view (fn [result] (for [r result] [:pre (pr-str r)]))</description>

      <description>My mom complained about an English only TV series on Disney+. What&amp;rsquo;s a helpful son to do?
As it happens, streaming to a Chromecast is not hard, but sending subtitles to it seems to be all but impossible. So, hardcoded subs it is (Just like the nineties, how retro!).
   Step by step    This was the easiest way to get some subtitled videos on TV:</description>

      <description>Hiccup is a domain-specific language for generating HTML, used mostly in Clojure community.
For every day use you need very little knowledge of Hiccup, and fortunately (most of it) is surprisingly simple.
   Let&amp;amp;rsquo;s Hiccup   The most obvious thing you can use Hiccup for is to style the titles of Advanced Queries:  #+BEGIN_QUERY {:title [:h3 &amp;#34;This is hiccup!&amp;#34;]  :query [:find (pull ?b [*])  :where  [task ?</description>

      <description>Hugo testpage    This is a testpage, this is the kind of page you would store in Logseq, to be exported to Hugo
  This is just a second paragraph.
     This should be another headline    With some text
