      <description>Intro &amp;ndash; taste and time There are plenty of Window Managers for Linux and *BSD, some of the more famous ones are I3, Awesome WM, OpenBox, but there are many more.
It is impossible to say which one is the best, the word best is a terrible qualifier, what does it mean best? The smallest, fastest, the one with the most things you can edit?
Despite all that, XMonad is one of the best window managers.</description>

      <description>The whole point of using a tiling window manager is distractionless working. Unfortunetely the rest of the world does not always agree. Enter WhatsApp. WhatsApp is easy to use, and (in my part of the world) very popular. For a long time I used it from my phone, but that is not really convenient. Copying and pasting obviously is problematic, but the whole taking up your phone completely ruins any semblamce of workflow.</description>
