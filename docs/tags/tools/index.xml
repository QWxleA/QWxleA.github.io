      <description>BleachBit is one of those apps that you don&amp;rsquo;t really think about, but are great to have. As far as I can tell it is possible to do everything the app does in shell-scripts, bur honestly, do you have time to figure out wh is cluttering up your harddisk all the time? I rather spend time on my zsh config.
The latest version came out in Januari 2021, and it has a cleaner for zoom now.</description>
