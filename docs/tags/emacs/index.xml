      <description>Remembering is hard. Well, not for everybody, but for the average person, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s hard. But, since leaving our caves, we have been busy creating tools. To remember things the best tools seems to be Spaced repetition (Wikipedia):
 Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.</description>
