      <description>Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their  daily activities  (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in which these processes support work activities (Wright 2005). It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own  growth and learning  (Smedley 2009). It is a  bottom-up approach  to knowledge management (KM) (Pollard 2008).</description>

      <description>Notes    The habit of starting all writing in the daily note reduces friction and stress
  It is just easy, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to think where stuff goes. Journaling in itself reduces stress
  If I like it I can put it in more permanent place
  Play-space, solves high barrier. Prototype and just write.
    Logging progress in the daily journal creates the possibility to see progress</description>
