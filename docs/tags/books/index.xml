      <description>The Harry Potter books, despite being &amp;lsquo;young adult&amp;rsquo; books, are a great read. Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable.
As with all great series, when it&amp;rsquo;s over, then what?
For Harry Potter, it&amp;rsquo;s fanfiction, most of it is terrible, but some is actually great:
 Fanfic: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality  Surprisingly, it even has a wikipedia page. It was published as a serial from 28 February 2010 through to 14 March 2015.</description>

      <description>Read most of the series in 2018, at least, what had been available then. Genesis fleet I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet.
The Lost Fleet is a military science fiction series written by John G. Hemry under the pen name Jack Campbell. The whole series feels very &amp;lsquo;greek&amp;rsquo;, which is no surprise: Hemry acknowledged in an interview that The Lost Fleet was inspired by Xenophon&amp;rsquo;s Anabasis, detailing the return march of the Ten Thousand, and myths about kings returning to save their nation.</description>
