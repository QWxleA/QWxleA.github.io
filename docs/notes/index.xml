      <description>My mom complained about an English only TV series on Disney+. What&amp;rsquo;s a helpful son to do?
As it happens, streaming to a Chromecast is not hard, but sending subtitles to it seems to be all but impossible. So, hardcoded subs it is (Just like the nineties, how retro!).
   Step by step  This was the easiest way to get some subtitled videos on TV:
 Take an English only video file, from somewhere on the internet (exercise left to the reader.</description>

      <description>NOTICE: this tutorial is outdated
Note: Second point: if you copy/paste queries, go over the code again, Logseq sometimes adds extra line-breaks / characters in strange places. Personally, I write my (longer) queries in vscode, and then, remove all tab-characters, and then copy the query to Logseq
In the following 9 examples we will walk through variou queries for Logseq. The tutorials are intended for beginners getting started with advanced queries in Logseq.</description>

      <description>A small query that lists all the changes, made during the last 24 hours.
With some pointers from @lauren#0001 and @Miro#1174 and a bit of help from google, I found: logseq/query_react.cljs , which pointed to three additional helpers:
:right-now-ms which is this moment in milliseconds from 1970
:start-of-today-ms which points to this morning 0:00
:end-of-today-ms which points to tonight 24:00
They can be used like this:
#+BEGIN_QUERY {:title [:h2 &amp;#34;My 24h changes&amp;#34;] :query [:find (pull ?</description>

      <description>From a question on the Logseq forum: Creating a Resonance Calendar from queries
A resonance calendar is taken from a video created by Ali Abdaal How I use Notion as a Resonance Calendar - YouTube. It&amp;rsquo;s a list of interesting (resonating) resources, added to your notes. Resources can be one of:
Movies
Podcasts
Articles
How to implement this in logseq?
   Step 1 â€” gather a list of items  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  #+BEGIN_QUERY {:title [:h2 &amp;#34;Resonance list 1&amp;#34;] :query [ :find (pull ?</description>

      <description>ElementaryOS is a gorgeous Linux distribution, and ever since they released Odin, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dying to try it. After installing it in a VM, and seeing the last bugs get ironed out, I finally caved, and installed it. It&amp;rsquo;s fabulous!
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to rumors, there have been some complaints about the lack of software, and some of the defaults, but imho, with elementary OS 6 Updates for August, 2021 those complaints should be layed to rest.</description>
