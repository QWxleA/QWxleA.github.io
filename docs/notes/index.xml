      <description>A small query that lists all the changes, made during the last 24 hours.
With some pointers from @lauren#0001 and @Miro#1174 and a bit of help from google, I found: logseq/query_react.cljs , which pointed to three additional helpers:
 :right-now-ms which is this moment in milliseconds from 1970 :start-of-today-ms which points to this morning 0:00 :end-of-today-ms which points to tonight 24:00  They can be used like this:
#+BEGIN_QUERY {:title [:h2 &amp;#34;My 24h changes&amp;#34;] :query [:find (pull ?</description>

      <description>Playing around with queries can be detrimental to the health of your graph as you may create blocks and pages just for testing purposes. Use a dedicated playground graph for this!  Second point, if you copy/paste queries, go over the code again, Logseq sometimes adds extra line-breaks / characters in strange places. Personally, I write my (longer) queries in vscode, and then, remove all tab-characters, and then copy the query to Logseq</description>

      <description>From a question on the Logseq forum: Creating a Resonance Calendar from queries
A resonance calendar is taken from a video created by Ali Abdaal How I use Notion as a Resonance Calendar - YouTube. It&amp;rsquo;s a list of interesting (resonating) resources, added to your notes. Resources can be one of:
 Movies Podcasts Articles  How to implement this in logseq?
   Step 1 â€” gather a list of items  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  #+BEGIN_QUERY {:title [:h2 &amp;#34;Resonance list 1&amp;#34;] :query [ :find (pull ?</description>

      <description>ElementaryOS is a gorgeous Linux distribution, and ever since they released Odin, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dying to try it. After installing it in a VM, and seeing the last bugs get ironed out, I finally caved, and installed it. It&amp;rsquo;s fabulous!
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to rumors, there have been some complaints about the lack of software, and some of the defaults, but imho, with elementary OS 6 Updates for August, 2021 those complaints should be layed to rest.</description>
