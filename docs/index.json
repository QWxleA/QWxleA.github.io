What\u0026rsquo;s a helpful son to do?\nAs it happens, streaming to a Chromecast is not hard, but sending subtitles to it seems to be all but impossible. So, hardcoded subs it is (Just like the nineties, how retro!).\n   Step by step    This was the easiest way to get some subtitled videos on TV:\n  Take an English only video file, from somewhere on the internet (exercise left to the reader.)\n  Find subtitles, cannot find anything in Dutch, find in English, easy to do.\n  Translate with Google translate (surprisingly good, Ulysses this tv-series is not, but still, happily surprised).\n  The timings are often wrong. SubShifter - Online SRT Subtitle Resync Tool is a good tool. I just use VLC to find when people start to talk and sync with this. The couple of times I\u0026rsquo;ve done this it was just to find a correct start.\n  Next the key to the whole conundrum: HandBrake: Open Source Video Transcoder. This app has been around for years, but is still actively developed and relatively easy to use.\n  A good alternative is Subler, it is way faster, but cannot hardcode subs, so for this Handbrake is the obvious choice.\n     Handbrake   To setup Handbrake for encoding on an M1, you need to use the correct settings (the app is universal): Configuration: Video \u0026gt; H.265 (VideoToolbox) \u0026amp; Chromecast 1080p        \n+ These settings cut the encoding time in half (still _not_ instantaneous). Next, add everything to the queue and get something to eat.     Playback — attempt 1    The easiest way to send a video file to a Chromecast is using the Chrome Browser:\n  Serve files: python3 -m http.server 8080+\n  Open in Google Chrome+\n  ⫶ \u0026gt; Cast \u0026gt; TV (Chromecast), done+\n Worked well, but no way I get my mom to run a local webserver.       Playback — attempt 2   VLC is a decent player, and it\u0026rsquo;s old, so people are bound to have used it: Use VLC to stream, open file Then Playback \u0026gt; Renderer \u0026gt; TV (Chromecast)  ","date":"Apr 08","permalink":"https://QWxleA.github.io/page/streaming-to-a-chromecast/","tags":["video"],"title":"Streaming to a chromecast"},{"categories":"hugo","contents":"   Hugo testpage    This is a testpage, this is the kind of page you would store in Logseq, to be exported to Hugo\n  This is just a second paragraph.\n     This should be another headline    With some text\n  And some more\n     Headline 3    Lorem lipsum\n  Lipsum lorum\n       Headline 4    Lorem lipsum\n  Lipsum lorum\n         Markdown thingies    This is bold text is bold\n  Cursif text is obviously not bold\n  No idea what to  do with highlighted text \n     Links    Links and Cross References | Hugo\n  External links Front Matter | Hugo should just carry over\n  But internal links to [[logseq] should be translated as [logseq](https://QWxleA.github.io/page/logseq/)\n       Code blocks    Code blocks are the most complicated part:\n [this is a simple code block]        [?b :block/name ?name]    More testing  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at an image:\n  But not on the main level\n But in a sub-block      \nThis is a quote  This is a note  This is a tip  This is important  Caution here  This is pinned  This is a warning  This is an example  ","date":"Mar 17","permalink":"https://QWxleA.github.io/page/hugo-testpage/","tags":["testing"],"title":"Hugo - testpage"}]
