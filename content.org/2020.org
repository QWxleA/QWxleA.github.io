   Read most of the series in 2018, at least, what had been available then. Genesis fleet I haven't read yet.

   The Lost Fleet is a military science fiction series written by John G. Hemry under the pen name Jack Campbell. The whole series feels very 'greek', which is no surprise: Hemry acknowledged in an interview that The Lost Fleet was inspired by Xenophon's Anabasis, detailing the return march of the Ten Thousand, and myths about kings returning to save their nation. In the same interview, Hemry, based on his own military experience, found Geary to be his ideal commanding officer. Ancestor worship is a belief system fairly homogeneously embraced within Hemry's universe. ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Fleet#section=7][wikipedia]])

   Science Fiction is probably my favorite genre of fiction. Unfortunately I haven't read as much as I would like. This is a list of what I read in 2019:

   - [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29][Dune]] -- the audiobook is excellent. The plan is to finally read more on the dune universe. See [[/posts/dune-it-started-so-great][Dune -- it started so great]]
   - [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_of_the_Moon][Malazan -- Gardens of the Moon]] -- great story. While reading you feel you're in a large universe, with endless possibilities.

   The Harry Potter books, despite being 'young adult' books, are a great read. Maybe not perfect, but definitely enjoyable.

   As with all great series, when it's over, then what?

   For Harry Potter, it's fanfiction, most of it is terrible, but some is actually great:

   - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Fanfic: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]

   Surprisingly, it even has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][wikipedia]] page. It was published as a serial from 28 February 2010 through to 14 March 2015. It consists of 122 chapters and 661,619 words. I read the whole thing twice :-).

   And it has been printed in book form:

*** Publication order

    Publication order sort-of works -- it's the order that Bujold wrote the stories in, after all -- but she jumps back and forth in Miles's life fairly randomly. Publication order works for those who prefer to read the books in - more or less (Barrayar was half-written as the continuation of Shards of Honour, abandoned for several years, and then completed) -- the order the author wrote them.

     - 'Aftermaths' (Spring 1986)
     - Shards of Honour (June 1986)
     - The Warrior's Apprentice (August 1986)

   Time travel Books, imported this from somewhere to remember.

   - *The Door Into Summer* by **Robert Heinlein** (1956). This is not your typical time travel novel for two reasons. First, paradox -- a big element in most time travel stories -- is virtually absent from this novel. Second, while there is travel into the future and the past, they are done through different techniques. Traveling into the future is done via “cold sleep” (e.g. suspending animation), while traveling into the past is done via a time machine. And as can often be found in Heinlein novels, there is also a cat involved in this one. ([[https://www.tor.com/2010/02/10/incredibly-readable-robert-heinleins-lemgthe-door-into-summerlemg/comment-page-1/][tor books]])

  - *Up the Line* by **Robert Silverberg** (1969). Until recently, this was my favorite time travel novel. Unlike The Door Into Summer, this one is loaded with paradox. Time travelers are tourist who visit historical events, with the result that many of the people attending the actual event are not contemporaries but visitors from the future. There is a Time Patrol that tries to prevent people from breaking the rules of time travel and that adds some complications. But it is the ending of this book–the very last line–that makes it so spectacular. I’m not going to spoil it for you if you haven’t read it. It’s worth finding a used copy.

  - *Timescape by* **Gregory Benford** (1980) won both the Nebula and the Campbell Memorial Award. It is the story that takes place in two time frames: a future in which earth is ecologically ruined; and a past in which physicists seems to be picking up a code from the future. It involves not only a kind of time travel (via communication from future to past), but alternate history and alternate time tracks that involve the Kennedy assassination. There is a reference in the book to a character meeting “David Selig” on a Manhattan college campus. When I read that, I emailed Benford and asked him if this was an intentional reference to Robert Silverberg‘s protagonist in Dying Inside. And indeed it was! Wonderful, outstanding book.

  - *Doomsday Book* by **Connie Willis** (1992). A Hugo and Nebula winner that completely blew my mind when I read it for the first time last year. Oxford historians use time travel to study the past. One historian goes back to study the “Black Death” but becomes stuck in that time. Over the course of her stay there, she lives through this outbreak and sees the toll it takes on the people that surround her. It is captivating and horrifying and funny and thought-provoking and I was completely wiped out when I finished reading the book.

  - *Timequake* by **Kurt Vonnegut** (1997). A unique “time travel” novel that examines the meaning of time travel and free will. A time-quake occurs that shifts everyone on earth back in time by 2 years. Those 2 years have to be relived with the knowledge of what will happen, but absolutely no ability to change the outcome.

  - *Terraforming Earth* by **Jack Williamson** (2003). Most of this novel was originally serialized in Science Fiction Age, and while not everyone liked it, I think it is a unique example of a time travel story. In this novel, the “time travel” is done through genetic engineering. In order to preserve the human genome, clones are created that live initially on a space station. These clones grow old and die and eventually a new generation of clones is created, on and on and on for millions of years. Civilizations are born and die while these clones watch. The narrative structure of this novel is interesting. Each of the clones in each generation are named the same so that it feels like we are looking at the same characters over the course of millions of years.

  - *The Time Traveler’s Wife* by **Audrey Niffenegger** (2003). This is the story of two lovers forced to deal with an illness in which one of them bounces randomly through time. -- Note: Hated the movie

  - *The Accidental Time Machine* by **Joe Haldeman** (2007). If you want a fun science fiction novel, this is it. A student invents a time machine (accidentally, of course) that can only move forward through time in ever increasing intervals. This is a fun ride into distant imagined futures and I remember having a blast reading the book. -- Listened to it as an audiobook

  - *Time Travelers Never* Die by **Jack McDevitt** (2009). Another fun time-travel novel, this one is perhaps closest to Silverberg’s Up the Line in its themes. It is all about paradox and the consequences thereof, and challenges the notions of what would happen if I ran into my past-or-future self. I could tell that Jack McDevitt had a lot of fun writing this one. And there is a wonderful, touching scene at the end that I really enjoyed.

  - *Blackout/All Clear* by **Connie Willis** (2010). This is the novel the ousted Up the Line from its position as my favorite time travel novel to second-favorite. Blackout/All Clear isn’t only the best time travel novel I’ve ever read, it’s one of the best novels period. It revisits the universe from Doomsday Book. This time, historians are studying the Blitz of London in World War II. Once there, they begin to find discrepancies with history, to say nothing of the fact that their “drops” that return them to the future are not opening and they appear to be stuck. The novel was broken into two parts because it was too long to publish as one book. The six month wait between the two was one of the longest waits of my life (it was then that I read Doomsday Book to fill the void). It combines time travel, historical fiction, and World War II into a stunningly complex and entertaining story that had me in tears at the end. And I was there at the Nebula Weekend a few weeks ago to see Connie Willis take home the Nebula for the novel. It was well-deserved.

  - *The End of Eternity* by **Isaac Asimov** There are so many great ideas in this 1955 novel, it's hard to believe nobody's made it into a movie — although apparently there were film versions in the Soviet Union and Hungary. Asimov envisions Eternity, a group of super-powerful time-travelers from the distant future, who travel "upwhen" and "downwhen," across the centuries, changing history to create the most benign possible timeline. But maybe Eternity's idea of the "most benign" timeline isn't actually the best for humanity after all?

  - *Hyperion* by **Dan Simmons** This book has been optioned for film several times, but never actually filmed. And it's too bad, because this weird spin on The Canterbury Tales has so many fantastic ideas. Including the Time Tombs, which are mysterious artifacts that travel backwards in time, and a monster called the Shrike that is associated with them. A group of pilgrims travels to Hyperion in an age-old ritual, and on the way they each tell stories — it sets up an epic story that continues in the second book, and at one point the plan was to combine the first two books into one movie.

  - *Kindred* by **Octavia Butler** We've had 12 Years a Slave, so maybe we're finally ready for a movie of Kindred, in which a present-day woman keeps traveling back in time to visit her ancestors — who include both slaves and slave owners. Dana has to learn to survive the institution of slavery and become part of the plantation's community. But she also has to ensure her own existence, which involves her cruel, callous slave-owner ancestor Rufus.

  - *Replay* by **Ken Grimwood** You should just go read Brad Meltzer's essay about what Replay meant to him and why he was so eager to option the movie rights at one point. This isn't exactly a time-travel book, it's a time-looping book (one of two on this list). The main character dies at age 43 and then lives his adult life over again, and this keeps happening — which means he gets several chances at getting it right, except that it's not that simple. As Meltzer says, "this book isn't a thriller. Rather, it's an instruction manual."

  - *The Shining Girls* by **Lauren Beukes** We loved this book about a serial killer who travels through time, targeting "shining girls" who have the potential to make the world a better place. As Beukes explained to us, she explores a fatalistic universe with "loops and paradoxes," in which you cannot escape your destiny. This leads to a great examination of what history is, and whether progress can be derailed by one person's insanity. It's an edge-of-the-seat thriller that leaves you pondering its big questions long after you close the book.

  - *The Man Who Folded Himself* by **David Gerrold** OK, so this one could be hard to capture on screen because of all the orgies where the main character has sex with alternate versions of himself. So many, many orgies. But then again, we live in a world where Lars von Trier has already created explicit orgies on screen, with CG-pasted heads on peoples' bodies. So you never know, right? And at its heart, this is a moving, fascinating story with a lot on its mind. As we wrote back in 2007, "Though it begins as a sex romp, The Man Who Folded Himself winds up being a meditation on trying to find yourself when there are so many possible selves you could have."

  - *The First 15 Lives of Harry August* by **Claire North** Here's the other time-looping novel, where someone lives his life over and over again. But unlike Replay, this book really is a kind of thriller, and it's immensely clever and satisfying in a way that could actually translate to film really beautifully. One clever bit — not only does Harry August live his whole life over and over, but so do a whole society of other people. And the mechanics are carefully worked out, so that all of these immortals share a "turn" each time, and can rewrite history on each turn through the loop. But someone is trying to bring about the end of the world early, and is killing other immortals... permanently.

  - *Woman on the Edge of Time* by **Marge Piercy** Here's another classic time-warping novel that has meant a lot to many people. And I could see this becoming a fascinating period piece, in the vein of Predestination. Basically, in the 1970s, Connie Ramos is trapped in a horrible dystopian mental institution, where they want to give her brutal therapies. And then somehow, she finds herself traveling forward in time to two possible futures: a utopia where people live in peace in happy communities, and a dystopia where people's minds are controlled by a handful of overlords who live on space stations. And Connie has a chance to prevent the dystopian future from taking shape, through her actions in the 1970s.

  - *Doomsday Book* by **Connie Willis** Really, all of Connie Willis' Oxford Time Travel stories would be great movies. She has a great, coherent rationale for time travel that rules out paradoxes, because the time machine won't let you visit any time where you could cause a major change to history. In this first novel, a woman historian goes back to the Middle Ages, but discovers that nothing is what she expected — and she's landed up in the middle of the Black Plague.

  - *The Shadow out of Time* by **H.P. Lovecraft** This short novel was recently rediscovered in its most authoritative version and republished in book form. And it's got all of the things that make Lovecraft such a fecund source for movie adaptations: mysterious eldritch creatures, a complex mythos, horrific discoveries and alienation. Plus a crazy-pants time travel plot. The Yith, super-advanced creatures, send their minds forward in time to take over the bodies of people in the present, including an unlucky Miskatonic University professor named Nathaniel. And it turns out that the Yith are worried about the Elder Things, which may be destined to destroy them unless they can keep fleeing into the future.

** DONE Quickly accessing WhatsApp on Xmonad                            :xmonad:

   The whole point of using a tiling window manager is distractionless working. Unfortunetely the rest of the world does not always agree. Enter *WhatsApp*. WhatsApp is easy to use, and (in my part of the world) very popular. For a long time I used it from my phone, but that is not really convenient. Copying and pasting obviously is problematic, but the whole taking up your phone completely ruins any semblamce of workflow. =Web.whatsapp.com= is a good first step, but (for me) it was slow. Switch to browser, find the tab (one of 843...), send a smiley, back to work, euh, what was it I was doing?

   But Xmonad has [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Util-NamedScratchpad.html][scratchpads]], a straight-forward module that gives arbitary popup-applications. HOw to use this with WhatsApp? From the documentation:

   Create =named scratchpads= configuration in your =xmonad.hs= like this:

   #+begin_src haskell
   import XMonad.StackSet as W
   import XMonad.ManageHook
   import XMonad.Util.NamedScratchpad
   #+end_src

   Create a scratchpad, containing WhatsApp:

   #+begin_src haskell
     scratchpads = [
     NS "myWhatsApp" spawnWhatsApp findWhatsApp manageWhatsApp
     ] where
        spawnWhatsApp  = "chromium --app=https://web.whatsapp.com/"
        findWhatsApp   = appName =? "web.whatsapp.com"
        manageWhatsApp = customFloating $ W.RationalRect l t w h
                   where
                     h = 0.9
                     w = 0.9
                     t = 0.95 -h
                     l = 0.95 -w
   #+end_src

   Add keybindings:

   #+begin_src haskell
     , ((modm .|. controlMask .|. shiftMask, xK_w), namedScratchpadAction scratchpads "scWhatsapp")
   #+end_src

   And finally, a manage hook:

   #+begin_src haskell
     , manageHook = namedScratchpadManageHook scratchpads
   #+end_src
*** Bonus:

    This little script uses xprop to print window information (if available) in formats usable within your =xmonad.hs=.

    *Source:* [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions][Haskell wiki]]

    #+begin_src shell
      #! /bin/sh
      exec xprop -notype \
        -f WM_NAME        8s ':\n  title =\? $0\n' \
        -f WM_CLASS       8s ':\n  appName =\? $0\n  className =\? $1\n' \
        -f WM_WINDOW_ROLE 8s ':\n  stringProperty "WM_WINDOW_ROLE" =\? $0\n' \
        WM_NAME WM_CLASS WM_WINDOW_ROLE \
        ${1+"$@"}
    #+end_src

*** Working with git submodule

    Adding a submodule is very simple, here I add a theme to this site:

    #+begin_src shell
      git submodule add https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus.git themes/cactus
    #+end_src

    Updating as well:

    #+begin_src shell
      git submodule update --remote --merge
    #+end_src

    Removing, not so much, the long version (google-fu):

    - Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file.
    - Stage the .gitmodules changes git add .gitmodules
    - Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
    - Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
    - Run rm -rf .git/modules/path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
    - Commit git commit -m "Removed submodule "
    - Delete the now untracked submodule files rm -rf path_to_submodule

    Remove a theme

    #+begin_src shell
      git submodule deinit -f themes/fuji #-f local changes
      git rm -f themes/fuji
      git commit -m "Removed submodule"
      rm -rf .git/modules/themes/fuji
    #+end_src
