 Why zines?

Remember first time I saw a zine, or maybe more precise, this is the first time I remember.

Link

Beginning of the nineties, magazines all over, unlike today. I really don't know anybody who still reads magazines. Which is sad in a way, because a magazine does have some posts over blogposts, curation, and cooperation.

Zines share the pluses of magazines.

Used to read many magazines, don't remember virtually any of them. Zine, yes.

Rop Kongrijp, xs4all.

Sorry lol I'm history of zones, shoes history of specific sub-cyltures.

## Cyberpunk

Zines are very cyberpunk. Not capitalistic, nobody gets paid, underground, freedom to write, show what we want.

Why is this good? Polar opposite of a zone is Facebook. Lowest common denominator. With excesses fat beyond what is good for society at large.

No limits at all? No limits are good, limits in art,
Limits in words, shoes values of group, eg no hate-speech (which is a lot more complicated, then what you would think).

    #+NAME:   fig:tunnnel-ngrok
    [[/images/640px-Williamson_Tunnels_-_The_Banqueting_Hall.png]]

   [[https://gohugo.io/documentation/][Hugo]] is able to quickly update a site, and makes improving and bug-fixing very simple. Showing your work-in-progress online is not as simple, and probably not what you want, anyway. Comes in [[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]].

   > ngrok allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet. Just tell ngrok what port your web server is listening on.

   Installation is simple, just download from [[https://ngrok.com/download][here]], and put it in your path.

   Forwarding a local hugo session is as simple as:

   #+begin_src shell
     ngrok http 1313
   #+end_src

   To automate it:

    #+begin_src shell
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # var for session name (to avoid repeated occurences)
      SN="hugostuff"
      PROJ="$(pwd)"

      tmux new-session -s "$SN" -n "$PROJ" -d

      tmux new-window -t "$SN:1" 'hugo -D -w server --disableFastRender'
      tmux new-window -t "$SN:2" 'ngrok http 1313'

      # Select window #1 and attach to the session
      tmux select-window -t "$SN:2"
      tmux -2 attach-session -t "$SN"
   #+end_src


   And ... that did not work well at all. On my machine it worked perfectly, but outside, where localhost did not work, my test-project missed all js-, css- and img-files. The solution is not hard, this is what I found in the theme:

   #+begin_src html
     <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ "/" | relLangURL }}"><img class="logo" src="{{ "img/logo.jpeg" | absURL }}" alt="{{ .Site.Title }}"></a>
   #+end_src

   If you use =absURL=, you end up with **localhost** in the complete url, but if you use =relURL=, you get a relative link:

   #+caption: [[https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/][Hugo documentation]]
   #+begin_src html
     {{ "mystyle.css" | absURL }} → "https://example.com/hugo/mystyle.css"
     {{ "mystyle.css" | relURL }} → "/hugo/mystyle.css"
   #+end_src

   Source: [[https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/][Hugo documentation]]

   So, the problem was solved doing a quick find-replace: =s/absURL/relURL/g=

   #+begin_src html
     <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ "/" | relLangURL }}"><img class="logo" src="{{ "img/logo.jpeg" | relURL }}" alt="{{ .Site.Title }}"></a>
   #+end_src

   Finally! Profit!

   Surfing I ran into [[https://512kb.club/][512kb.club]], which lamented:

   > The internet has become a bloated mess. Massive javascript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

   And I agree, the web is becoming unusable, or at least annoying, and we should all do our part. As the name implies, to become part of the club XXX, the "... total UNCOMPRESSED web resources must not exceed 512KB." Mine did, so, time to put my slim down my site.

   Initial size, 349.9Kb, uncompressed, 558.1Kb:

   #+caption: 558.1 Kb -- not good enough
   [[/images/diet-size.png]]

   The biggest assets my site uses are the *Font Awesome* icons, so that's the obvious place to start. But how to get rid of those files (without loosing my icons)? Looking over my site I noticed that I don't really use all that many icons, just for **mastodon**, **github** and **email**. Why not replace those icons with (inline) svg icons instead? That thought lead me to [[http://oostens.me/posts/hugo-resources-inline-svg-icons/][this excellent page]].

   The short of it is:

   1. Create =<workdir>/assets/svg=, and dump the svgs in here.
   2. Add partial in =<workdir>/layouts/partials/inline-svg.html=.
   3. Add the shortcode in =<workdir>/layouts/shortcodes/inline-svg.html=.
   4. Add scss in =<workdir>/assets/sass/2-components/_svg.scss=

   #+caption: partial inline-svg.html
   #+begin_src html
     {{ $svg := resources.Get (print "svg/" . ".svg") }}
     <i class="inline-svg" >{{ $svg.Content | safeHTML }}</i>
   #+end_src

   #+caption: shortcode inline-svg.html
   #+begin_src html
     {{- partial "inline-svg" (.Get 0) -}}
   #+end_src

   #+caption: _svg.scss
   #+begin_src css
     .inline-svg {
       display: inline-block;
       vertical-align: middle;

       svg {
         width: 1em;
         height: 1em;
         fill: currentColor;
         display: inline-block;
       }
     }
   #+end_src

   All this should result in the following shortcode:

   #+begin_src html
     {{</* inline-svg "mastodon" */>}}
   #+end_src

   And if everything is correct, this prints a mastodon icon: {{< inline-svg "mastodon" >}}, yes!

   5. Next, replace all Font awesome icons.

      Find svg-icons from [[https://iconify.design/icon-sets/][iconify.design]]. Fix your template ... profit!

** INPROGRESS XMonad from scratch -- day 1 -- Starting small            :xmonad:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: xmonad-from-scratch-day-1
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :description
   :END:

*** Intro -- taste and time
    There are plenty of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers][Window Managers]] for Linux and *BSD, some of the more famous ones are [[https://i3wm.org/][I3]],

    It is impossible to say which one is the best, the word *best* is a terrible qualifier, what does it mean *best*? The smallest, fastest, the one with the most things you can edit?

    Despite all that, XMonad is **one** of the **best** window managers. Why? Because it is really, really good at managing windows. With a little bit of elbow grease you can make it do whatever you want. And it can even look really good doing it:

    #+CAPTION: This is what your desktop could look like ... if you have taste, and lots of time
    #+NAME:   fig:xmonad-1
    [[/images/xmonad-day1-1.png]]

    In this series we will help you configure XMonad to do what you want, or at least, give you the tools to do so. BTW, allthough this desktop looks really good, it is by no means the most advanced configuration around.

    Links:

    - [[https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0][Axarva/dotfiles-2.0]] - really good looking XMonad install

*** TODO Dev-environment

    Experimenting is fun, but loosing all your work not so much, we will set up a simple dev-environment that we can use to play around.

    Script:


    For reference:

    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xephyr][Arch wiki - Xephyr]]
*** Mimimal - lets start small

    XMonad is written in [[https://www.haskell.org/][haskell]], which is a really weird language. But, as XMonad proves, it is very powerfull, and you don't have too understand all (any?) of it to be able to use XMonad for yourself. We will start small, and slowly add more functionality to our setup, explaining what we actually added.

    **Installation:**

    A minimal install needs the following, I am using Arch, but you can do the same on Ubuntu Slackware or whatever else you want to run, just use your flavor of package-manager. Arch is just a good base-line, as the packages it installs are as close to upstream as possible:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar dmenu xterm
    #+end_src

    **XMonad** is XMonad itself, **xmonad-contrib** is a library of extra functionality, this is what makes XMonad so outstanding, **dmenu** is minimal a program launcher, and **xterm** is the default terminal. It looks a bit spartan, but it is enough to get a lot done, actually.

    To start up XMonad, to quote [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad#Starting][the Arch Wiki]]:

    #+begin_quote
    Run xmonad with xinit (1).

    Alternatively, select Xmonad from the session menu in a display manager of choice (2).
    #+end_quote

    1. Which, translated for mortals means you add / create a file called =$HOME/.xinitrc=, which contains the line:

    #+CAPTION: bare xinitrc
    #+begin_src sh
      exec xmonad
    #+end_src

    You can now start XMonad using **startx**

    Note: On arch you need to install **xorg-xinit**, which contains =/usr/bin/startx=

    2. If you use a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager][display manager]], like GDM or SSDM, you can just choose *xmonad* when you login.

    For reference:

    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad][xmonad - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmobar][xmobar - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu][dmenu - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xterm#Installation][xterm - ArchWiki]]

    Right, now we have the base of our setup.
    We will be following: [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen%27s_Configuration][John Coerzen]]




  About as bare as it gets, the only changes from the default are:

  - favourite terminal
  - favourite keybinding

  #+begin_src haskell :tangle  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
  import XMonad

  main = xmonad defaultConfig
          { modMask = mod4Mask -- Use Super instead of Alt
          , terminal = "alacritty"
          -- more changes

   This is where things get interesting. Xmonad has a /lot/ of different layout. We'll start with my favourites.

   New modules:

   =Mirror= takes a layout, and rotates it, twicw the fun with one layout!

   Added a keybinding =M-tab=, the default is =M-space=, to go the next layout.

  - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-NoBorders.html][XMonad.Layout.NoBorders]] -- Make a given layout display without borders. This is useful for full-screen or tabbed layouts, where you don't really want to waste a couple of pixels of real estate just to inform yourself that the visible window has focus.
  - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Gaps.html][XMonad.Layout.Gaps]] -- Create manually-sized gaps along edges of the screen which will not be used for tiling, along with support for toggling gaps on and off.
  - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Spacing.html][XMonad.Layout.Spacing]] -- Add a configurable amount of space around windows.

    After accidently closing Xmonad instead of a stupid zoom-popup:

    New modules:

    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Prompt-ConfirmPrompt.html][XMonad.Prompt.ConfirmPrompt]] -- Prompt the user to confirm a given action. We offer no completion and simply ask to confirm (ENTER) or cancel (ESCAPE).
    - System.Exit


    Some windows just are not a part of your regular workflow, take /pavucontrol/, it's meant to control your audio, and then it's closed again. No need to keep it around, give it a place. That's the kind of window you typecally want to /float/.

    Then there are the popup windows, annoying, but they exist. They should not take up real-estate, move around your carefully grafted grid. For this we use the XXX module.

    New modules:

    - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-StackSet.html#t:StackSet][XMonad.StackSet]]
    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-ManageHelpers.html][XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers]] - This module provides helper functions to be used in manageHook. For one it has the function =isDialog=, which you can use to match dialogs, =OBS= has a gazillion of them, so having a catch-all makes things a /lot/ easier.

      We added [[(mhelpimport)][import]]

*** TODO EWMH rewrite

    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints][EWMH]] might not sound very interesting, but X11 has some great utilities that use /Extended Window Manager Hints/.

    Two examples are =Wmctrl= and =xdotool=, great time-savers that can be used in scripts to glue things together.

    Module: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-EwmhDesktops.html][XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops]] - Makes xmonad use the EWMH hints to tell panel applications about its workspaces and the windows therein. It also allows the user to interact with xmonad by clicking on panels and window lists.

    To use it, [[(ewmhimport)][import]] it, and then [[(ewmh)][activate]] it. ???activate

   Using prompts for recurring actions

   Add more

   Many things we keep doing over and over:

   - searching online with a search engine
   - looking up someting on the Arch wiki

   Xmonad has a prompt module, let's add some more functionality to it:


*** TODO Manage windows

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n
      (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Eadasxclusive or. "
        (if a (not b) b))ss
    #+END_SRC

    After accidently closing Xmonad instead of a stupid zoom-popup:

    New modules:

    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Prompt-ConfirmPrompt.html][XMonad.Prompt.ConfirmPrompt]] -- Prompt the user to confirm a given action. We offer no completion and simply ask to confirm (ENTER) or cancel (ESCAPE).
    - System.Exit


    Some windows just are not a part of your regular workflow, take /pavucontrol/, it's meant to control your audio, and then it's closed again. No need to keep it around, give it a place. That's the kind of window you typecally want to /float/.

    Then there are the popup windows, annoying, but they exist. They should not take up real-estate, move around your carefully grafted grid. For this we use the XXX module.

    New modules:

    - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-StackSet.html#t:StackSet][XMonad.StackSet]]
    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-ManageHelpers.html][XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers]] - This module provides helper functions to be used in manageHook. For one it has the function =isDialog=, which you can use to match dialogs, =OBS= has a gazillion of them, so having a catch-all makes things a /lot/ easier.

      We added import

*** TODO EWMH rewrite

    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints][EWMH]] might not sound very interesting, but X11 has some great utilities that use /Extended Window Manager Hints/.

    Two examples are =Wmctrl= and =xdotool=, great time-savers that can be used in scripts to glue things together.

    Module: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-EwmhDesktops.html][XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops]] - Makes xmonad use the EWMH hints to tell panel applications about its workspaces and the windows therein. It also allows the user to interact with xmonad by clicking on panels and window lists.

    To use it, import it, and then activate it. ???activate

**** Layout

      Extending layouts for daily use:

      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-WindowNavigation.html][XMonad.Layout.WindowNavigation]] -- WindowNavigation is an extension to allow easy navigation of a workspace. See here for the new key bindings. TODO alternative for =windows W.focusUp=
      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-LimitWindows.html][XMonad.Layout.LimitWindows]] -- A layout modifier that limits the number of windows that can be =shown=. My screen is not all that big, more then four windows is silly in most cases. Notice that the layout =shows= four windows, the other ones are still there, just not shown!

      Magnifing a layout:

      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Magnifier.html][XMonad.Layout.Magnifier]] -- This is a layout modifier that will make a layout increase the size of the window that has focus.
      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-ResizableTile.html][XMonad.Layout.ResizableTile]] -- More useful tiled layout that allows you to change a width/height of window.

      I use this to flip back and forth between a video, playing at 2/3d of the screen and a terminal, also at 2/3d where I follow the lesson / video. Uses ref:resize and ref:magnify

      Floating windows:

      Fullscreensupport: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Fullscreen.html][XMonad.Layout.Fullscreen]] -- Provides a ManageHook and an EventHook that sends layout messages with information about fullscreening windows. This allows layouts to make their own decisions about what they should to with a window that requests fullscreen.
