 Why zines?

Remember first time I saw a zine, or maybe more precise, this is the first time I remember.

Link

Beginning of the nineties, magazines all over, unlike today. I really don't know anybody who still reads magazines. Which is sad in a way, because a magazine does have some posts over blogposts, curation, and cooperation.

Zines share the pluses of magazines.

Used to read many magazines, don't remember virtually any of them. Zine, yes.

Sorry lol I'm history of zones, shoes history of specific sub-cyltures.

## Cyberpunk

Zines are very cyberpunk. Not capitalistic, nobody gets paid, underground, freedom to write, show what we want.

Why is this good? Polar opposite of a zone is Facebook. Lowest common denominator. With excesses fat beyond what is good for society at large.

No limits at all? No limits are good, limits in art,
Limits in words, shoes values of group, eg no hate-speech (which is a lot more complicated, then what you would think).

SF, poetry

 This is for those who might be new to the series and were wondering the order in which to read them. While the main plot in each book is begun and wrapped up in each novel, there is also a continuing plot from one book to the next. New books tend to refer to past events so in order to avoid confusion it might be best to read them in the the order published.

    #+NAME:   fig:tunnnel-ngrok
    [[/images/640px-Williamson_Tunnels_-_The_Banqueting_Hall.png]]

   [[https://gohugo.io/documentation/][Hugo]] is able to quickly update a site, and makes improving and bug-fixing very simple. Showing your work-in-progress online is not as simple, and probably not what you want, anyway. Comes in [[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]].

   > ngrok allows you to expose a web server running on your local machine to the internet. Just tell ngrok what port your web server is listening on.

   Installation is simple, just download from [[https://ngrok.com/download][here]], and put it in your path.

   Forwarding a local hugo session is as simple as:

   #+begin_src shell
     ngrok http 1313
   #+end_src

   To automate it:

    #+begin_src shell
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # var for session name (to avoid repeated occurences)
      SN="hugostuff"
      PROJ="$(pwd)"

      tmux new-session -s "$SN" -n "$PROJ" -d

      tmux new-window -t "$SN:1" 'hugo -D -w server --disableFastRender'
      tmux new-window -t "$SN:2" 'ngrok http 1313'

      # Select window #1 and attach to the session
      tmux select-window -t "$SN:2"
      tmux -2 attach-session -t "$SN"
   #+end_src


   And ... that did not work well at all. On my machine it worked perfectly, but outside, where localhost did not work, my test-project missed all js-, css- and img-files. The solution is not hard, this is what I found in the theme:

   #+begin_src html
     <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ "/" | relLangURL }}"><img class="logo" src="{{ "img/logo.jpeg" | absURL }}" alt="{{ .Site.Title }}"></a>
   #+end_src

   If you use =absURL=, you end up with **localhost** in the complete url, but if you use =relURL=, you get a relative link:

   #+caption: [[https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/][Hugo documentation]]
   #+begin_src html
     {{ "mystyle.css" | absURL }} → "https://example.com/hugo/mystyle.css"
     {{ "mystyle.css" | relURL }} → "/hugo/mystyle.css"
   #+end_src

   Source: [[https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/][Hugo documentation]]

   So, the problem was solved doing a quick find-replace: =s/absURL/relURL/g=

   #+begin_src html
     <a class="navbar-brand" href="{{ "/" | relLangURL }}"><img class="logo" src="{{ "img/logo.jpeg" | relURL }}" alt="{{ .Site.Title }}"></a>
   #+end_src

   Finally! Profit!

   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :description

   Surfing, I ran into [[https://512kb.club/][512kb.club]], on which the writer lamented:

   > The internet has become a bloated mess. Massive javascript libraries, countless client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the course these days.

   And I agree, the web is becoming unusable, or at least annoying, and we should all do our part. As the name implies, to become part of the club, the "... total UNCOMPRESSED web resources must not exceed 512KB." Mine did, so, time to put my slim down my site.

   Initial size, 349.9Kb, uncompressed, 558.1Kb:

   #+caption: 558.1 Kb -- not good enough
   [[/images/diet-size.png]]

   The biggest assets my site uses are the *Font Awesome* icons, so that's the obvious place to start. But how to get rid of those files (without loosing my icons)? Looking over my site I noticed that I don't really use all that many icons, just for **mastodon**, **github** and **email**. Why not replace those icons with (inline) svg icons instead? That thought lead me to [[http://oostens.me/posts/hugo-resources-inline-svg-icons/][this excellent page]].

   The short of it is:

   1. Create =<workdir>/assets/svg=, and dump the svgs in here.
   2. Add partial in =<workdir>/layouts/partials/inline-svg.html=.
   3. Add the shortcode in =<workdir>/layouts/shortcodes/inline-svg.html=.
   4. Add scss in =<workdir>/assets/sass/2-components/_svg.scss=

   #+caption: partial inline-svg.html
   #+begin_src html
     {{ $svg := resources.Get (print "svg/" . ".svg") }}
     <i class="inline-svg" >{{ $svg.Content | safeHTML }}</i>
   #+end_src

   #+caption: shortcode inline-svg.html
   #+begin_src html
     {{- partial "inline-svg" (.Get 0) -}}
   #+end_src

   #+caption: _svg.scss
   #+begin_src css
     .inline-svg {
       display: inline-block;
       vertical-align: middle;

       svg {
         width: 1em;
         height: 1em;
         fill: currentColor;
         display: inline-block;
       }
     }
   #+end_src

   All this should result in the following shortcode:

   #+begin_src html
     {{</* inline-svg "mastodon" */>}}
   #+end_src

   And if everything is correct, this prints a mastodon icon: {{< inline-svg "mastodon" >}}, yes!

   5. Next, replace all the 'Font awesome' icons.

      Find svg-icons from [[https://iconify.design/icon-sets/][iconify.design]]. Fix your template ... profit!

   #+caption: Much better! 348.3 Kb
   [[/images/diet-size-2.png]]

   Further steps, replace the logo with an svg, and use the same svg for the favicon. Minimize the svgs with [[https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/][svgomg]]. REmove the last webfont, and improve the font-stack.

   #+caption: Yes! 167 Kb That's more like it.

*** Ad blocker

    It is impossible to use the web nowadays without a half decent ad-blocker. The first line of defense should be your DNS, so blocking some 40k sites at the DNS level clears up a lot of trash. Blokada is really good, I only notice how good using somebody elses Internet connction.

    Afaik this is a good and secure app: [[https://blokada.org/][blokada.org]] (doesn't need root)
*** App store
    This one is tricky. Some apps that I need cannot be downloaded from F-Droid. Sideloading sounds shady, how can I trust this third party site?

    I have both installed, but do my best to download more from [[https://f-droid.org/][F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository]].

    This seems interesting, and I plan to test it on my rooted old phone: [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/][Yalp Store | F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository]]

    *Description:* Yalp Store lets you download apps '''directly''' from Google Play Store '''as
    apk files'''. It can search for '''updates''' of installed apps and lets you
    '''search''' for other apps. Yalp saves downloaded apks to your default download
    folder. Other features include browsing categories, viewing and leaving reviews,
    black/whitelisting apps for updates, filtering apps by being free/paid and
    containing/not containing ads.

*** Audio / Video conferencing

    Zoom is terrible. It is also what everybody in my surroundings use. For now no possible alternatives.
*** Contacts, AddressBook and Reminders

    Android phones have a linked google account, which has a linked address book. It is probably one of the worst things to give to Google, but ... it's very convenient. [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/][DAVx⁵ - F-Droid]] looks like a nice(r) alternative, but I would have to setup a way to sync my data.

    Tasks can be used entirely offline, or synchronized with Google Tasks, CalDAV, or EteSync. It might be a good combo with DAVx5.
*** Ebooks
    [[http://moondownload.com/][Moon+ Reader for Android]], I really like this app, I bought it a long time ago, and use it regularly. Don't really know any alternatives, but haven't really looked.
*** Exercise
    Looked into this, and a lot of apps on the play store look really shady. [[https://gitlab.com/enjoyingfoss/feeel/-/wikis/home][Feeel - GitLab]] looks really nice, but so far I have been to lazy to really use it. I thought it interesting that the author asked for photos as a way to contribute.

    Also: [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks/][OpenTracks]]
*** File synchronisation
    [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] is a famous app, I have tried it several times, but I have never been able to get it to work right. There was always something. Maybe because I only use mobile internet, so everything is connected to my phone, and that messes up the syncing? No idea, but I should really get this working, one day.
*** Habit forming
    [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/][Loop Habit Tracker]] is a simple app that helps you create and maintain good habits, allowing
    you to achieve your long-term goals. Detailed graphs and statistics show you how
    your habits improved over time. I mostly use Emacs, but this app looks really nice.
*** Keyboard

     [[https://anysoftkeyboard.github.io/][AnySoftKeyboard]] -- gestures, dark-mode and multiple languages, and doesn't spy on you. This is just a good app. Installed it not long ago, but have no complaints, so far.
*** Maps
    [[https://osmand.net/][OsmAnd]] is a great app, the offline support is perfect (as in really nice), but Google Maps is better. I should not be using it, but so far it is hard to break the habit. Installed OsmanA (again), and will do my best.
*** Messaging
    Not really a fan of messaging in general, and everybody I know uses WhatsApp, which doesn't help. Element, a Matrix client seems to be a much better alternative:Android, [[https://github.com/vector-im/element-android][vector-im/element-android]] and desktop, [[https://github.com/vector-im/element-web][vector-im/element-web]]
*** Music
     [[https://neutroncode.com/apps/player][Neutron Music Player]] is imho the best music player on Android. I bought it quite a while ago and don't intend to exchange it for something else. I didn't study it as far as security is concerned, but the developer is a hardcore audio nerd and it's hard to imagine him adding spyware to his pride and joy.
*** Online Radio
     [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.programmierecke.radiodroid2/][RadioDroid]] is a new app for me, the app also supports the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon][Music Player Daemon - ArchWiki]]. So far I really don't listen to the radio all that much. The app is ok.
*** Password manager
    Probaly the most important part of your personal digital security. I'm satisfied with [[https://bitwarden.com/][Bitwarden]], although I use their server, which is not the optimal solution. A better / more secure solution would be [[http://www.keepassdroid.com/][KeePassDroid]], combined with something from [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KeePass][KeePass - ArchWiki]], but Bitwarden is very easy / convenient.
*** Podcasts

    This is another hard one. I have been using [[https://www.pocketcasts.com/][Pocket Casts]] for years, bought it actually, and it is a very nice and convenient app. [[https://antennapod.org/][AntennaPod]] is the best free and open app, it is quite good, just not as streamlined as Pocket Casts. I'll keep what I have for now, but it's good to know a good enough second option exists.
*** RSS
    I don't really use RSS on my phone, I use [[https://newsboat.org/][Newsboat]] on my desktop, and if you can't sync then it's just annoying. [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/][Feeder]] looks like a good app, but as I mostly work from home it is not that relevant at the moment. [[https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fox.tttrss/][Tiny Tiny RSS]] would be a good idea if I ever get TTR installed on a publicly accessible server.
*** Social Media
    This one (should be) easy. Twitter bad, Mastodon good. I use  [[https://tusky.app/][Tusky]] often, but am playing with [[https://github.com/fwgs/husky][Husky]]. Let the best win! I like that it is possible to use both.
*** Spaced repetition
    Anki exists both on the desktop ([[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards]]), and on Android, [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ichi2.anki/][AnkiDroid]]. The server is closed source, but it's possible to run your own server with [[https://github.com/ankicommunity/anki-sync-server][anki-sync-server: A personal Anki sync server]]. See also: [[*Spaced repetition -- Learning with Emacs and Anki][Spaced repetition Learning with Emacs]].
*** Web Browsers
    This is a big one. Firefox has been very good for a while, so there really is no reason not to use it. Unfortunetely on the desktop, Chromium is better/easier for web-devel, and I slowly started using that. But Google has been helpful, [[https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-cuts-off-other-chromium-based-browsers-from-its-sync-service/][promising to cut off Chromium]], so that's a good reminder not to put our trust in our multi-alphabetical overlords.

    Firefox (beta) with sync is very convenient, it is possible to host a sync server as well:

    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox_Sync_Server][Firefox Sync Server - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncserver][mozilla-services/syncserver: Run-Your-Own Firefox Sync Server]]

    The [[https://www.torproject.org/download/][tor browser]] is a good browser as well, I just don't have a good use-case for it. I use it more for fun then anything.

    [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.klar/][Firefox Klar]], installed it (again), and put it on my front-page. Let's see if I can use it more. It *is* that you can lock the app with a fingerprint. Absolutely no extra work, and one extra step insecurity.

*** Wine - the liquid version, not the Windows not-emulator

    Closed source, and they send annoying email, but the app is very good, and the recommendations tasty: [[https://www.vivino.com/][Vivino.com - Buy the Right Wine]]. No alternatives afaik.

*** YouTube Music and SoundCloud

    This one is easy, nothing beats [[https://newpipe.net/][NewPipe - a free YouTube client]]. The UI is a little bit clunckier then the YouTube app, but it lacks adds, and even more important, you can listen to music with your screen locked, eg, with your phone in your pocket, which is kind of the point of a mobile phone.

    This app is the best app for Youtube, bar none. The only downside is that sometimes Google does something shady, and the app stops working. Then it's time to update. Not a big deal, but still, annoying.

** DONE Hangul

   After an interesting [[https://rage.love/@ljwrites/105592890222523701][conversation]] on Mastodon, I thought it would be interesting to look into  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Letters][Hangul]] or Korean, for the non-initiated. Languages are always fascinating, and non-latin languages doubly so. I can only read Latin, Cyrillic, and (Ancient) Greek, so anything to the west of Europe is new and interesting. On to hangul.

   The first article I read was [[https://www.mondly.com/blog/2020/05/25/hangul-korean-alphabet-pronunciation/][A Quick Guide to Hangul, the Korean Alphabet - Pronunciation and Rules]] on 'mondly', an app I use on my phone to improve my French. It's not really helping, but the app is not to blame. An interesting quote from the article was:

   > For hundreds of years before Hangul was created, Koreans wrote using Classical Chinese characters (which they called Hanja) alongside other native phonetic writing systems. However, many lower-class people didn’t know how to read or write because of the fundamental differences between Korean and Chinese and, of course, because of the large number of Chinese characters. After all, even today, many people find Chinese and Japanese very difficult to learn because of their complex writing systems. My scientific research ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sassy_Girl_(TV_series)][Wikipedia]]) noticed the same thing:

   #+caption: Chinese writing in the Joseon era
   [[/images/hangul-chinese.png]]

   Both Chinese and Japanese have, or use an enormous amount of characters, which makes it definitely nin-trivial for the non-native speaker to even get a glimpse of the language. The Korean alphabet, on the other hand, has only 24 basic latters, and they use not more then 5 strokes, so they don't look too complicated. Having studied several eastern european languages in the past, it was interesting to see several sounds we don't really have in the west, have equivalents in Korean and cyrillic, for example ㅈ (romanized 'ch', but not really see [[*Further reading][Further reading #3]] ) is somewhere between ч 'chai' or 'checkmate' and ц 'tsar'. Also, it always amazes me that, listening to the videos, it is obvious that for the native speaker, the diferences between sounds are very clear, and obvious, but to me it often sounds as if they just repeat the same sound. It was the same studying Russian, and I remember when I gradually started to notice the difference between sounds, it's fascinating how the brain works!

   [[*Spaced repetition -- Learning with Emacs and Anki][Downloaded and installed Anki]] with a 'hangul' deck, let's see how that goes.

   Remembering is hard. Well, not for everybody, but for the average person, yes, it's hard. But, since leaving our caves, we have been busy creating tools. To remember things the best tools seems to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition][Spaced repetition (Wikipedia)]]:

   > Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase rate of learning.

   The idea is to memorize 'hungul', the Korean alphabet. A popular tool seems to be [[https://ankiweb.net][anki]], open-source software that makes it easy to create and use 'decks' of cards. There are a whole bunch of decks for Korean, but I started out with [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1831087318][this one]]. What I especially like is the possibility to use anki both on my phone ([[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.ichi2.anki/][AnkiDroid]]) and one my computer.

   After setting it up, I remembered [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8720][reading about org and anki]]. So, with a bit of googling I now have a simple setup to create my own cards. For Emacs, the second link under *Further reading* is excellent, for Anki, the 3rd.

   But first: let's memorize some more Korean characters, here's a small comic: ㅎㅂ ㄹㅆ ㄱㅎ ㄲㅎ (a man with a Hat, carrying a Bucket, sees a Ratelsnake, which hiSSes. the man with the Hat takes his Gun, and then the man with the Hat pulls the trigger to Kill the snake)

*** Intro -- taste and time
    There are plenty of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers][Window Managers]] for Linux and *BSD, some of the more famous ones are [[https://i3wm.org/][I3]], [[https://awesomewm.org][Awesome WM]], [[https://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox][OpenBox]], but there are many more.

    It is impossible to say which one is the best, the word *best* is a terrible qualifier, what does it mean *best*? The smallest, fastest, the one with the most things you can edit?

    Despite all that, XMonad is **one** of the **best** window managers. Why? Because it is really, really good at managing windows. With a little bit of elbow grease you can make it do whatever you want. And it can even look really good doing it:

    #+CAPTION: This is what your desktop could look like ... if you have taste, and lots of time
    #+NAME:   fig:xmonad-1
    [[/images/xmonad-day1-1.png]]

    In this series we will help you configure XMonad to do what you want, or at least, give you the tools to do so. BTW, although this desktop looks really good, it is by no means the most advanced configuration around.

    **Links:**

    - [[https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0][Axarva/dotfiles-2.0]] - Bling! A really good looking XMonad install

*** Dev-environment

    Experimenting is fun, but loosing all your work not so much, so we will set up a simple dev-environment that we can use to play around.

    **Needed:**

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo pacman install xorg-server-xephyr xterm
    #+end_src

    For your convenience, here is a little shell-script that can help you run XMonad in xephyr, which is, in a window o your desktop. Doing it like this will make it easy to experiment, while keeping your daily driver intact. Then, when you're happy with it, you can move the XMonad configuration to either =$HOME/.xmonad= or, what I do, =$HOME/.config/xmonad=. XMonad will read either one.

    The script will (in the directory you run it from, for example =$HOME/Desktop=, or wherever you do your experiments), create a folder called =state=. In state it will create 3 directories =config=, =cache=, and =data=.

    #+begin_src shell
      $ tree state
      state
      ├── cache
      ├── config
      └── data

      3 directories, 0 files
    #+end_src

    Script:

    #+CAPTION: run-in-xephyr v.0.1
    #+begin_src shell :tangle-mode (identity #o555) :tangle "~/bin/run-in-xephyr.sh"

*** Mimimal - lets start small

    XMonad is written in [[https://www.haskell.org/][haskell]], which is a really weird language. But, as XMonad proves, it is very powerfull, and you don't have too understand all (any?) haskell to be able to use XMonad for yourself. We will start small, and slowly add more functionality to our setup, explaining what we did.

    **Installation:**

    A minimal install needs the following, as you might have noticed, I am using Arch, but you can do the same on Ubuntu, Debian or whatever else you want to run, just use your flavor of package-manager. Arch is just a good base-line, as the packages it installs are as close to upstream as it gets:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib xmobar dmenu xterm
    #+end_src

    **XMonad** is XMonad itself, **xmonad-contrib** is a library of extra functionality (this is what makes XMonad so outstanding), **dmenu** is minimal a program launcher, and **xterm** is the default terminal. It looks a bit spartan, but it is enough to get a lot done, actually.

    To start up XMonad, to quote [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad#Starting][the Arch Wiki]]:

    #+begin_quote
    Run xmonad with xinit (1).

    Alternatively, select Xmonad from the session menu in a display manager of choice (2).
    #+end_quote

    1. Which, translated for mortals means you add / create a file called =$HOME/.xinitrc=, and run =startx=:

    #+CAPTION: bare xinitrc
    #+begin_src sh
      exec xmonad
    #+end_src

    **Note:** On arch you need to install **xorg-xinit**, which contains =/usr/bin/startx=

    2. If you use a [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager][display manager]], like GDM or SSDM, you can just choose *xmonad* when you login.

    **For reference:**

    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad][xmonad - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmobar][xmobar - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu][dmenu - ArchWiki]]
    - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xterm#Installation][xterm - ArchWiki]]

    Right, now we have the base of our setup. In our case, we will use =run-in-xephyr.sh=, which will put our environment in order, and run XMonad in a window on our desktop. But first, let's configure XMonad.

    Our first configuration is about as bare as it gets, the only changes from the default are:

  - favourite terminal
  - favourite keybinding

  #+caption: A minimal XMonad configuration
  #+begin_src haskell -n
  import XMonad

  main = xmonad def
          { modMask = mod4Mask -- Use Super instead of Alt
          , terminal = "alacritty"
          -- more changes
  }
  #+end_src

  **Explanation:**

  - line 1: XMonad does not come with all bells and whistles, you have to import libararies for functionality, starting with XMonad itself
  - line 3: **main:** this is a real haskell program, and haskell starts with *main*, next we call xmonad with the default config *def* (see [[xmonad1-default][here]])
    The changes we make in lines 4 and 5 override the defaults.
  - line 4: **modMask** is a variable xmonad has defined, we give it the value *mod4Mask* (Super).
  - line 5: **terminal**, default is xterm, we prefer *alacritty*.

  And that's it, your first haskell program!

  **Sidenote:** This really *is* a haskell program, if you want to, you can start up =ghci=, the haskell interpreter, and load your =xmonad.hs=. When your config gets more eleborate you can even interact with it in the interpreter!

  **Alternative**

  If you are using Super (or the Windows key, but we'll call it Super from now on) in your current WM (like I do), then use:

  #+caption: Even less of a XMonad configuration
  #+begin_src haskell
  import XMonad

  main = xmonad def
          { modMask = mod4Mask -- Use Super instead of Alt
          , terminal = "alacritty"
          -- more changes
  }
  #+end_src

  Note that xmonad>=0.11 has by default a list of the default keybindings bound to =M-S-/= or =M-?= (Depending on your settings, either =Alt+Shift+/=, or =Super+Shift+/=.

*** My own keys - 1

    Add simple(r) keybindings. It will add to the existing ones, overriding them if nececeray.

    Module: [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.14/docs/XMonad-Util-EZConfig.html][XMonad-Util-EZConfig]]

    It's a good habit to read at least the intro of your new modules.

        xmonad $ defaultConfig
            { modMask = mod4Mask     -- Rebind Mod to the Windows key
            , terminal = "alacritty"
            } `additionalKeys`
            [ ((mod4Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_z), spawn "xscreensaver-command -lock")
            , ((controlMask, xK_Print), spawn "sleep 0.2; scrot -s")
            , ((0, xK_Print), spawn "scrot")

*** My own keys - 2 Emacs

    Add Emacs-style keybindings (=additionalKeysP=). For a list of keys, see [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.14/docs/XMonad-Util-EZConfig.html#v:mkKeymap][here]].

    Module: [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.14/docs/XMonad-Util-EZConfig.html][XMonad-Util-EZConfig]]

*** My own keys - 3 descriptions

    Next we'll be adding [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Util-NamedActions.html][XMonad.Util.NamedActions]].

    A wrapper for keybinding configuration that can list the available keybindings.

    Notice the difference beween the old help (which we haven't disabled yet) =M-?= and the new =M-<f1>=!

      import XMonad.Util.Run(spawnPipe)
      import XMonad.Util.EZConfig
      import XMonad.Util.NamedActions
      import System.IO

      main = do
         xmonad $ addDescrKeys ((mod4Mask, xK_F1), xMessage) myKeys
                         defaultConfig { modMask = mod4Mask , terminal = "alacritty"}

      myKeys c = (subtitle "Custom Keys":) $ mkNamedKeymap c $
         [ ("M-e", addName "Emacsclient" $ spawn "emacsclient -nc")
         , ("M-b", addName "Qutebrowser" $ spawn "qutebrowser")
         , ("M-c", sendMessage' Expand)]
          ^++^
         [("<XF86AudioPlay>", spawn "mpc toggle" :: X ()),
          ("<XF86AudioNext>", spawn "mpc next")]
    #+end_src

    See also new-style and old-style (needs =:: X ()=!) used, divided by =^++^=.

     With a nice little macro? to make it look better.

   =Mirror= takes a layout, and rotates it, twicw the fun with one layout!

   Added a keybinding =M-tab=, the default is =M-space=, to go the next layout.

    After accidently closing Xmonad instead of a stupid zoom-popup:

    New modules:

    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Prompt-ConfirmPrompt.html][XMonad.Prompt.ConfirmPrompt]] -- Prompt the user to confirm a given action. We offer no completion and simply ask to confirm (ENTER) or cancel (ESCAPE).
    - System.Exit


    Some windows just are not a part of your regular workflow, take /pavucontrol/, it's meant to control your audio, and then it's closed again. No need to keep it around, give it a place. That's the kind of window you typecally want to /float/.

    Then there are the popup windows, annoying, but they exist. They should not take up real-estate, move around your carefully grafted grid. For this we use the XXX module.

    New modules:

    - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-StackSet.html#t:StackSet][XMonad.StackSet]]
    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-ManageHelpers.html][XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers]] - This module provides helper functions to be used in manageHook. For one it has the function =isDialog=, which you can use to match dialogs, =OBS= has a gazillion of them, so having a catch-all makes things a /lot/ easier.

      We added [[(mhelpimport)][import]]

*** TODO EWMH rewrite

    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints][EWMH]] might not sound very interesting, but X11 has some great utilities that use /Extended Window Manager Hints/.

    Two examples are =Wmctrl= and =xdotool=, great time-savers that can be used in scripts to glue things together.

    Module: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-EwmhDesktops.html][XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops]] - Makes xmonad use the EWMH hints to tell panel applications about its workspaces and the windows therein. It also allows the user to interact with xmonad by clicking on panels and window lists.

    To use it, [[(ewmhimport)][import]] it, and then [[(ewmh)][activate]] it. ???activate

   Using prompts for recurring actions

   Add more

   Many things we keep doing over and over:

   - searching online with a search engine
   - looking up someting on the Arch wiki

   Xmonad has a prompt module, let's add some more functionality to it:


*** TODO Manage windows

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n
      (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Eadasxclusive or. "
        (if a (not b) b))ss
    #+END_SRC

    After accidently closing Xmonad instead of a stupid zoom-popup:

    New modules:

    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Prompt-ConfirmPrompt.html][XMonad.Prompt.ConfirmPrompt]] -- Prompt the user to confirm a given action. We offer no completion and simply ask to confirm (ENTER) or cancel (ESCAPE).
    - System.Exit


    Some windows just are not a part of your regular workflow, take /pavucontrol/, it's meant to control your audio, and then it's closed again. No need to keep it around, give it a place. That's the kind of window you typecally want to /float/.

    Then there are the popup windows, annoying, but they exist. They should not take up real-estate, move around your carefully grafted grid. For this we use the XXX module.

    New modules:

    - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-0.15/docs/XMonad-StackSet.html#t:StackSet][XMonad.StackSet]]
    - [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-ManageHelpers.html][XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers]] - This module provides helper functions to be used in manageHook. For one it has the function =isDialog=, which you can use to match dialogs, =OBS= has a gazillion of them, so having a catch-all makes things a /lot/ easier.

      We added import

*** TODO EWMH rewrite

    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Window_Manager_Hints][EWMH]] might not sound very interesting, but X11 has some great utilities that use /Extended Window Manager Hints/.

    Two examples are =Wmctrl= and =xdotool=, great time-savers that can be used in scripts to glue things together.

    Module: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Hooks-EwmhDesktops.html][XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops]] - Makes xmonad use the EWMH hints to tell panel applications about its workspaces and the windows therein. It also allows the user to interact with xmonad by clicking on panels and window lists.

    To use it, import it, and then activate it. ???activate

**** Layout

      Extending layouts for daily use:

      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-WindowNavigation.html][XMonad.Layout.WindowNavigation]] -- WindowNavigation is an extension to allow easy navigation of a workspace. See here for the new key bindings. TODO alternative for =windows W.focusUp=
      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-LimitWindows.html][XMonad.Layout.LimitWindows]] -- A layout modifier that limits the number of windows that can be =shown=. My screen is not all that big, more then four windows is silly in most cases. Notice that the layout =shows= four windows, the other ones are still there, just not shown!

      Magnifing a layout:

      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Magnifier.html][XMonad.Layout.Magnifier]] -- This is a layout modifier that will make a layout increase the size of the window that has focus.
      - [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-ResizableTile.html][XMonad.Layout.ResizableTile]] -- More useful tiled layout that allows you to change a width/height of window.

      I use this to flip back and forth between a video, playing at 2/3d of the screen and a terminal, also at 2/3d where I follow the lesson / video. Uses ref:resize and ref:magnify

      Floating windows:

      Fullscreensupport: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.16/docs/XMonad-Layout-Fullscreen.html][XMonad.Layout.Fullscreen]] -- Provides a ManageHook and an EventHook that sends layout messages with information about fullscreening windows. This allows layouts to make their own decisions about what they should to with a window that requests fullscreen.

      Testing, works with browsers - (fsmain) (fs)
